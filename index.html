              Steve Jobs was a smart man. He had big ideas. He wanted to change
              the world. He said, ‚ÄúThink different.‚Äù He believed that technology
              should be simple. He wanted every product to look nice and feel
              easy to use. Jobs loved design. He cared about small details. He
              asked many questions. He did not give up. He always worked hard.
              He said, ‚ÄúStay hungry. Stay foolish.‚Äù That means: always learn,
              always try, never stop.

          <p>
            Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak started in a garage.
            <br />
            Mark Zuckerberg started in a small room.
            <br />
            They were not rich. They were not perfect.
            <br />
            But they had big ideas. And they worked hard.

            <br />
            You don‚Äôt need to be a genius.
            <br />
            You need passion. You need to try.
            <br />
            You need to believe in your dream.
            <br />
            Start small. Think big. Maybe one day, your idea can also change the
            world.
